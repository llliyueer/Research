# Research in 3D Reconstruction

## project: "**High-resolution quantitative reconstruction of gamma source and multi-modal augmented reality technology**"
### tasks:

-  Reconstruct the appearance of container by a binocular camera. 
-  Reconstruct the gamma-ray sources by a gamma camera.
-  Apply iterative algorithm to optimize the estimation of motion parameters of gamma camera.
-  Develop a novel point-dense algorithm based on Hough Transform.
-  Fuse the reconstruction results and render it in volume space.
-  Visualize the container and the gamma-ray sources simultaneously, with an adjustable transparency of the container.

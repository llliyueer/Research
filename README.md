# Research in 3D Reconstruction

## project: "**High-resolution quantitative reconstruction of gamma source and multi-modal augmented reality technology**"
### tasks:
- 1. Reconstruct the appearance of container by a binocular camera. 
- 2. Reconstruct the gamma-ray sources by a gamma camera.
- 3. Apply iterative algorithm to optimize the estimation of motion parameters of gamma camera.
- 4. Develop a novel point-dense algorithm based on Hough Transform.
- 5. Fuse the reconstruction results.
- 6. Render and Visualize the container and the gamma-ray sources simultaneously, with an adjustable transparency of the container.

### results: see **Visualization_Yueer_LI.gif**.

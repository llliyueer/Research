# Research in 3D Reconstruction
Undertaking the project on "**Research on the high-resolution quantitative reconstruction of gamma source and multi-modal augmented reality technology**" independently.
- Design a dual-camera detection system consisting of a binocular camera and a gamma camera.
- Estimate the accurate pose of gamma camera.
- Dense the point cloud by the method based on Hough Transform.
- Render the fusion in voxel space.
- Visualize the waste drum and the source within simultaneously.

**The research results is shown in *Visualization_Yueer_LI.gif*.**
